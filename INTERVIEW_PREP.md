## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What problem does your project solve?
**A:** It provides a simple, visual way to track and understand 3D orientation using affordable hardware and open-source software. Useful for robotics, gaming, and education.

### 2. How does the data flow from the sensor to the visualization?
**A:** The sensor (e.g., MPU6050) measures orientation. Arduino reads this data, calculates roll and pitch, and sends it over serial. Processing receives the data and updates the 3D visualization.

### 3. Why did you use Processing?
**A:** Processing is beginner-friendly, great for graphics, and has built-in serial support, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and visualization.

### 4. How do you handle noisy sensor data?
**A:** We use smoothing/interpolation (lerp) in Processing for smooth animation. On the Arduino side, sensor fusion or filtering (like complementary/Kalman filter) can be used.

### 5. What are possible improvements?
**A:** Data logging, real-time graphs, web interface, better error handling, and support for more sensors.

### 6. What challenges did you face?
**A:** Serial communication issues, sensor calibration, and synchronizing data rates between Arduino and Processing.

### 7. How did you work as a team?
**A:** We divided tasks: hardware setup, Arduino code, Processing visualization, and documentation. Regular meetings and code reviews helped us stay on track.

### 8. How would you scale this project?
**A:** Add support for more axes (yaw), use wireless communication (Bluetooth/WiFi), or integrate with VR/AR platforms.
